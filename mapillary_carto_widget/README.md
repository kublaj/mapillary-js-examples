# Mapillary Carto Widget
Takes your Carto maps and adds a Mapillary viewer widget.

## Setup
Open up api.js in a text editor. In the quotes after username put your Carto username. To select which map you want to use, enter the table from the map in the quotes after the table variable. The table name is located as the last argument in the sql tab in Carto. For example, if when the tab is expanded the text visible is SELECT * FROM speed_limit_statenisland, then the table name is speed_limit_statenisland. That's it!
