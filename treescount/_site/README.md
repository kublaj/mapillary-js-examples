###NYC Treescount 2015 Mapillary Viewer


The Mapillary viewer is an easy way to observe, verify, and update geospatial datasets using street-level imagery created using crowdsourced street-level imagery. This example shows how the NYC Treescount 2015 Blockfaces dataset can be viewed using the Mapillary viewer embedded in an ArcGIS webmap.

By visualizing the dataset in photos; we can:
- give community stewardship volunteers better tools to engage with the data
- target and priorite efforts to update the dataset where it becomes clear from the imagery where its outdated
- motivate more volunteers to capture their own photos to create fresh street level imagery to update the data


As a bonus, this can be part of an effort to create more comprehensive and current street level photo coverage of NYC that **can be licensed** for other use by NYC Parks and other agencies.  

Try the ArcGIS example [here](). (The NYC Treescount 2015 Blockfaces data is quite large and takes some time to load up. Sorry! Screenshots and video below.

Note:  This example happens to use the existing Mapillary for ArcGIS widget, but the Mapillary viewer is a simple JS library that can be integrated with any map platform (see more docs and examples [here]().
